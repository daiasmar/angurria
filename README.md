## Goal
The word 'ANGURRIA' in Latin America means 'greed' or 'eagerness to possess a lot of wealth for the sole pleasure of hoarding it without sharing it with anyone', and the game is structured around this meaning. The objective of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible and to know when to stop rolling the dice, the player with the most points wins the game.
## Game Rules
1. Angurria is played with two standard six-sided dice and has 10 rounds.
2. Each player takes turns in each round rolling the two dice and accumulating points.
3. At the beginning of each turn, the player rolls two dice and adds up the numbers to determine their score for that turn.
4. The player can choose to roll the dice as many times as they want during their turn, and the sum of the two dice is added to their score each time they roll.
5. However, if the player rolls a 7 during their turn, they immediately lose their turn and all the points accumulated during that turn.
6. The player can choose to end their turn at any time before rolling a 7 to keep the points accumulated up to the next turn.
7. The player with the most points at the end of the 10 rounds is declared the winner.
